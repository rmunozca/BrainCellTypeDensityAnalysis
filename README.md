Pipeline for registaring, analyzing and visualizing neuroanatomical point cloud data from whole brain imaging. The registration pipeline uses affine and b-spline transformations using intrinsic anatomical features with Elastix. 
The density-based analysis pipeline uses DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify clusters of neuronal cells and visualize their spatial distribution in 3D.
